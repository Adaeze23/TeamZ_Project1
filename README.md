# TeamZ_Project1
React SideHustle Internship Project1

First Project using React Js
The Google HomePage was Recreated as required.
The SideHustle Logo was used to replace Google's logo.
When a user types in the search input field, the SideHustle logo is updated in
the input field.
When the input field is empty, the logo is displayed again.
Enjoy!
